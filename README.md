# SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FINITE STATE MACHINE

DATE:

# AIM:

     To simulate and synthesis finite state machine using vivado.

# APPARATUS REQUIRED: **

      vivado 2023.2.

# PROCEDURE: **

STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project.

STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed.

STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.

STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.

STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.

STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.

STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.

VERILOG CODE:

module fsm(clk, rst, x, z);

input clk, rst, x;

output z;

reg [2:1] present_state, NEXT_STATE; 

parameter S0=2'b00, S1=2'b01, S2=2'b10, S3=2'b11;

always@(x,present_state)

case(present_state)

S0:	if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S1;

else

NEXT_STATE=S0;

S1:	if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S1;

else

NEXT_STATE=S2;

S2:	if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S3;

else

NEXT_STATE=S0;

S3:	if(x)

NEXT_STATE=S1;

else

NEXT_STATE=S2;

endcase

always@(negedge rst, posedge clk)

if(rst)

 present_state<=S0;

else 

present_state<=NEXT_STATE;

assign z=(present_state==S3);

endmodule

OUTPUT:
